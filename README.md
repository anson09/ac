# README

This project is suited for those who want to promote full-stack coding ability systematically üèó

All problems are implemented by vanilla js üíõ

## INDEX

Codes are divided into 4 parts: ü•ò

1. [JS Theory](./1_js_theory/)
2. [Data Structure](./2_data_structure/)
3. [Algorithm](./3_algorithm/)
4. [Leetcode](./4_leetcode/)

You can filter themes by tag #xxx

## About Leetcode Challenge

The leetcode run time and beat info could be used as a reference, but please not taking much seriously

Run time is calculated by the sum of all test cases, and making optimization is only needed when your submission is at the bottom or has a magnitude difference from the fastest one

Fun facts: üí°

- The test cases may be supplemented at any time. The earlier you submit, the fewer cases you need to run
- The run time of the same code may be different at each submission. The most extreme situation I met is submitting the same code twice, once 3s but once 2s, which is related to the server resource allocation and current usage
- Encountered the submission of the first 50% only gap 10ms, 50% seems huge, while the difference is just natural environment fluctuation
